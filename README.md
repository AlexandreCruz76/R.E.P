R.E.P - Reputation for Experience and Points
REP is a platform for analyzing and classifying the behavioral reputation and performance of users on the Solana network.
In a versatile way and without exposing the user, the REP solution speeds up the development of projects and products by connecting interested parties to absorb users with profiles compatible with the vision and behavior appropriate for a given product.

Reputation Policy: REP does not use any personified analysis of any user of the network or the portfolios submitted to the protocol, the REP algorithm consists of in-depth analysis of the behavior of portfolios and their assets that are divided into asset classes and categories, which associated with mathematical metrics define the user's reputation.
